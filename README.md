# Customizable Flow Field

## Description

The simulation creates a flow field of particles that move around the screen. The behaviur of the particles can be customized by changing the noise, speed, and thickness of the particles, as well as their color.

This is a dynamic flow field simulation using p5.js, where particles move around the screen. The particles’ motion is influenced by Perlin noise, resulting in their fluid and organic movements. The simulation also responds to mouse clicks, shifting to a new noise pattern each time, providing an interactive element to the visualization. If a particle moves off the canvas, it’s repositioned randomly within the canvas, ensuring a continuous flow. 

This project is a work in progress with plans for more customization options in the future.


## Future Enhancements and Features 

- **Noise**: Adjust the noise to change the randomness of the particle movement.
- **Speed**: Control the speed of the particles.
- **Thickness**: Change the thickness of the particles to create different visual effects.
- **Colour**: Customize the colour of the particles.
- **Music Interaction**: Add functionality to allow the particles to move in response to music.
